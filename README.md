# Pomodoro Timer App

> A simple pomodoro focus timer built using React.js

A classic verison of the pomodoro timer that lets the user adjust the focus and break timers, and displays a progress bar as each session progresses. 


## Screenshots
All relevant information is displayed on a single page in this app, by default the focus session is set to 25 min and the break session is set to 5 min. Once a user selects the begin session button a timer appears and counts down the remaining time in the session. While active a session can either be paused or stopped by the user. A progress bar visually depicts how long is left in each session.
